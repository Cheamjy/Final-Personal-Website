      <div class="text">Hi, my name is Cheam Jhun Yew from Malaysia. I am 18 years old this year and I am studying digital media at the University of West England Bristol. Abit of a background story of myself, i am a photographer based in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. 
        <br><br>
        The reason why I picked up photography is because a photo tells a thousand words. A cliche as it sounds, a photo is very powerful, it brings back memories, joy and laughter.
        <br><br>
        Thatâ€™s what drives me forward to keep pursuing this passion and dream as a photographer.
        <br><br>
        I also love playing badminton as this sport requires you to think a lot in a very short period of time. Furthermore, this sport is very fast paced and requires a lot of stamina and strength.

    <div class="text-2">Reflective essay</div>

    <div class="text-3">

        Throughout this whole assignment, there were a lot of things that I have learned and gained knowledge about. 
        <br><br>
        Firstly, making a website is challenging to make as this is my first time making one. Knowing just a few basic skills from the weekly worksheets made the job easier for me. During the start, I was scared as I didn't know how I was going to design the website. Making a wireframe and flowchart gave me a clear direction as to where I am supposed to start and what is going to be my end goal. However, not everything went as planned. As my knowledge in HTML and CSS is very good, I had to seek help from lecturers or google (W3 School). Overall, I learned a lot from making this website.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, learning different rules and ways to make a poster more interesting and how it could attract audiences' attention. 
        <br><br>
        Overall, this assignment was very beneficial to me as there were many things I thought were not important but when it is used, there is a big difference in the effect. This will help me in the future, not just for my assignments but also in work and many other things.
        <br><br>
        How I could improve myself is by studying before I start anything.
